# Pollen

Pollen is a live updating particle effects builder library for GameMaker based on JujuAdams' Vinyl!

READ THE REST OF THE DOCS HERE!! -> https://morphomonarchy.github.io/Pollen/#/

## Features
- A simpler & more flexible interface for creating GM particles in runtime
- Can use particles & GM particle assets as templates for new particles to reduce boilerplate
- Getter methods to directly get specific data from a particle instead of using the particle-info struct every time
- Setter methods with default args that can be chained together to “build” particles without redundant properties
- A simple JSON format for defining particles that can be live-reloaded
- Supports all of GameMaker’s built-in properties for Types, Emitters, & Systems, + more!

## Special Thanks
Huge shout out to JujuAdams for all the work done on Vinyl and for the GameMaker community in general. 
This library would not exist without your work, so thank you!

Also major thanks to CataclysmicStudios for the “Tome” library which helped generate the documentation site!
